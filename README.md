# 3D gravity inversion by planting anomalous densities

**Leonardo Uieda and Val√©ria C. F. Barbosa**

This paper presents a novel gravity inversion method
for estimating a 3D density-contrast distribution
defined on a grid of prisms. Our method consists of an
iterative algorithm that does not require the solution
of a large equation system. Instead, the solution
grows systematically around user-specified prismatic
elements called "seeds". Each seed can have a
different density contrast, allowing the interpretation
of multiple bodies with different density contrasts and
interfering gravitational effects. The compactness
of the solution around the seeds is imposed by
means of a regularizing function.
The solution
grows by the accretion of neighboring prisms of the
current solution. The prisms for the accretion are
chosen by systematically searching the set of current
neighboring prisms. Therefore, this approach allows
that the columns of the Jacobian matrix be calculated
on demand. This is a known technique from computer
science called "lazy evaluation", which greatly reduces
the demand of computer memory and processing time.
Test on synthetic data and on real data collected over
the ultramafic Cana Brava complex, central Brazil,
confirmed the ability of our method in detecting sharp
and compact bodies.
